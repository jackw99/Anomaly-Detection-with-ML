# Anomaly-Detection-with-ML
Implementations of machine learning for detection of common attacks in industrial IoT networks. Offline Classification of common attacks.

Attack 1: False-Data Injection Attacks
- Attacker will inject false data (e.g. tampering with readings of sensors in a network) to try and damage the network
- this causes down time and costs for the owner of the network to find and rectify the issue

Attack 2: Denial of Service Attacks (DoS)

- Attacker tries to prevent normal operating functions of a network by dsirupting the normal flow of the network
- this can be done by sending numerous false values into the network to throw off sensors

Attack 3: Replay Attack 

- Attacker chooses a valid data transmission to continously send through the network
- Attempts to increase network congestion and render network useless
